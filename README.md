# MIMAS
Models for the Individual Movemvents of Avian Species

MIMAS is designed to simulate the movements and locations of individual migratory birds throughout the full annual cycle. If you are interested in using MIMAS for an applied project, please don't hesitate to reach out! You can contact me at btonelli (at) ucla (dot) edu. If you feel brave, you can jump into the code as-is too!
